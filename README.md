# Marketing Campaign Data Analysis and Customer Segmentation

This project involves a detailed analysis of a marketing campaign dataset using Python within a Jupyter environment. The primary focus is on understanding customer behavior, identifying key segments, and leveraging predictive modeling to forecast future actions. The analysis is supplemented with visualizations and clustering techniques to aid in the interpretation of the data.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need to install Python and Jupyter. We recommend managing Python packages and environments with Anaconda or Miniconda.

- [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Install Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) - This can also be installed via Python's pip package installer or through the Anaconda distribution.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/marketing-campaign-analysis.git
   ```
2. **Access the file directory:**
   ```bash
   cd marketing-campaign-analysis
   ```
3. **Set up a Python environment (Optional but recommended):**
   If you're using Anaconda, you can create a new environment:
   ```bash
   conda create --name marketing-analysis python=3.x  
   conda activate marketing-analysis
   ```
   Alternatively, if you prefer using venv:
   ```bash
   python -m venv marketing-analysis
   source marketing-analysis/bin/activate  
   On Windows: marketing-analysis\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

###Opening the Project

After installation, you can open the project in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) which supports Jupyter notebooks natively.
* Open VS Code and navigate to the project folder.
* Open the Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) to start working with the data.

###Usage

Each Jupyter notebook cell contains code accompanied by Markdown descriptions to explain the analysis steps. To execute the code:
* Select the cell you want to run.
* Press Shift + Enter to execute the cell and move to the next one, or Ctrl + Enter to run the cell and remain on the same cell.
